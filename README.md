## Programs
### MIT PRIMES
High School Research for Math, Computer Science, and Biology. Apply [here](http://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/apply.php). Deadline: December 1.

### Kaggle
Kaggle usually has opportunities to learn about machine learning and AI as well as processing big data from real sources. The [Kaggle Website](kaggle.com).

### RSI
RSI is a summer camp hosted by MIT and is similar to PRIMES. Apply [here](https://www.cee.org/research-science-institute).

### Science Fair
The school science fair is a great way to find something to work towards. It usually happens in January(?). You can either work by yourself or in a group. You can pretty much submit anything to the science fair as long as you have a central idea driving your research (yes, is a very broad answer because science fair is pretty broad).

### Other Research Opportunities
Ask professors, look at their research and ask them if you can help them out. It probably helps to have a good idea of what you want to help them with and why it's worth their time.

## Contests
### USACO
The primary computer science olympiad. You can take the current years contests as well as do old practice problems, these are your best way to study for USACO. The [USACO Website](http://usaco.org). The contest dates are TBD.

### ACSL
An in-school, written and coding test more targeted towards general knowledge and coding practices. We will be sending out a packet with more information about this and ways to study for the contests. The contest dates are TBD.

### Kaggle
Machine learning competition on almost anything and everything. Real companies provide data to train on and if you are **really** good you can place high and win money and other random stuff. The [Kaggle Website](kaggle.com).

### Codeforces
Good practice for USACO and weekly contests from random companies. If you are really good you can get a high rating and even win money and free swag. The [Codeforces Website](https://codeforces.com).

### USACO Training Pages
Also good practice for USACO, but some of the questions are a little outdated and bashy. The [USACO Training Pages Website](https://train.usaco.org/usacogate).

### Virginia Tech High School Contest
A pretty relaxed programming contest hosted by Virginia Tech's ICPC Team. It is an online, team contest and we will usually send at least a couple teams to compete. The contest dates are TBD.

## Hackathons
### Metrohacks
Hack hosted by Harvard for high schoolers. Overnight event and usually has big sponsors and talks. There is also a womens varient that only women can attend. Probably biggest hackathon in MA for high schoolers.

### Blueprint
Hack hosted by MIT for high schoolers. Free Food, what's not to like? The mentors are all MIT students and pretty helpful.
