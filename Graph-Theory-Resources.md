# Graph Theory

## Helpful Links

### Introductory

In this section, you will find some introductory graph theory articles and links. The first two links are good for a general introduction and terminology.

- [A Gentle Introduction to Graph Theory](https://medium.com/basecs/a-gentle-introduction-to-graph-theory-77969829ead8)

- [Graph Theory (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmQR8Xy9DeM)

### BFS, DFS (Beginner)

There are also a few articles about BFS and DFS, both articles that utilise graphs to search for a particular node in that graph. 

- [Graph Search, DFS, BFS (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaBhtODEL0w)
- [Wikipedia: BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
- [Wikipedia: DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [BFS v. DFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bfs-and-dfs/)

### Flood Fill (Beginner)

Flood fill is an another  application of BFS/DFS on graphs.

- [Flood Fill](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/algorithms/flood-fill/)
- [More Flood Fill](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/flood-fill-algorithm/tutorial/)

### Union Find (Medium)

Union Find is a more advanced usage of graphs that can be used to find whether two given nodes are in the same graph.

### Minimum Spanning Trees (Medium)

Minimum Spanning Trees are the shortest possible length of a tree that extends through each of a set of given nodes.

### Other Stuff

Here are couple of other links that might be useful if you are interested. They aren't about a parituclar algorithm, but they do relate to graph theory applications/algorithms.

- [A nice summary of a bunch of these algorithms](http://ranger.uta.edu/~chqding/cse5311/Lectures/GraphTheory.pdf)
- [A cool six hour video about different ways you can actuallly apply this stuff](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-graph-theory-algorithms-from-a-google-engineer/)
- Search up "Computerphile Graph Theory" on YouTube, there are a bunch of cool videos about random stuff that are all pretty interesting and approachable.
