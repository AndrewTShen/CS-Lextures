# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a very useful topic in contest programming. The big idea here is that we can remember what information we have already computed. This way, we can greatly reduce our runtime for our programs. This is usually good for problems that can be solved iteratively, by looking at the previously computed states.
