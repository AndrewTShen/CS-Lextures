## Introduction
Vim is a very common command line text editor and is notorious for being very difficult to close. Despite the often negative stereotypes around Vim, it is actually a very powerful tool that can help you speed up development and offer easy ways to navigate and edit tools. It is even good for day to day usage of navagating through the file system.

## Installation
Most Windows, macOS, and Linux computers already have it installed, it's that popular. In the event that you don't already have it on your computer you can go to [The Vim Website](www.vim.org) to download a package for your computer.

For Windows and Linux, you can use `sudo apt-get install vim` and for macOS, you can use `brew install vim` or `brew install macvim`, which ever works best. At the high level both `vim` and `macvim` work the same way.
